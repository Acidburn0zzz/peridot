// TODO(rosswang): To me it makes sense to add a media.MediaCapturer
// speech_capturer here so that SysUI can request spoken input using the same
// interface as text, passing in a MediaCapturer (over which it has control in a
// pinch). However, for now this level of control from SysUI is not necessary,
// and since we have one speech to text provider but many ask handlers and since
// ask handlers currently forward UserInput but media capturers aren't cloneable
// and in any case ask handlers would not be passed the media capturer but
// rather the recognized text, let's keep this text-only for now. This does
// raise questions about whether we still want to diverge the inbound and
// outbound user input forms, and about how we want to handle more sophisticated
// media formats in the future. I believe eventually we'll want a processing
// pipeline so that agents can be as powerful or as basic as they want while
// leveraging the power of other agents known to the system.
