module modular;

// A service that takes an arbitrary query for a module (such as
// passed to the StartModule() method of Story) and translates it into
// the URL of an executable mojo app. Right now the implementation
// just passes through the query. Later this will actually do
// something non trivial, for example involving the component manager
// (at which point it might need parametrization and be obtained from
// a specific factory). This may all change, but it's here right now
// as a placeholder to make it easier to think about cooperation of
// the different components.
//
// Since a service instance doesn't take parameters, it's delivered
// directly by the application's ServiceProvider.
[ServiceName="modular.Resolver"]  // Created by resolver app.
