Example applications that use the modular runtime for composition.

Code in this directory is not in the modular namespace because it's meant to
demonstrate how it looks like to be a client of the modular codebase.

There are examples both in C++ and in dart/flutter.

For more details on how to develop flutter modules, refer
to [Flutter Module Development](HOWTO_FLUTTER.md).
