Example modules that exercise the story runner.

Code in this directory is not in the modular namespace because it's meant to
demonstrate how it looks like to be a client of the modular codebase.

This directory contains example modules written in C++ (`.cc` files) and in
flutter (See `flutter/` directory). For more details on how to develop flutter
modules, refer to the [Flutter Module Development](flutter/README.md) readme.
